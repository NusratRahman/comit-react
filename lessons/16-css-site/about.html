            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>
                I have 4 years' experience as an Information System Analyst and 2 years' experience as a teacher of GED (General Education Development) course in Bangladesh. My education history also combines Science and Commerce. I received Bachelor degree in Computer Science and Engineering while my MBA was on Human Resource Management. In both courses I obtained good grades. Mathematics is my favorite subject. I like brain storming. 
                <br> <br>
                I am a sincere, hard-working person with a strong desire to achieve goals. I can work flexible hours. I am a positive person who perform well under pressure.
